i'm in my final year at the university of technology sydney, studying my bachelor of science in information technology and bachelor of arts in information technology.

i'm looking forward to learning more about what the cybersecurity field has to offer. i expect this project to be a challenge, but i'm sure it will also be just as rewarding.

### my career plan
i find fulfilment in creating things that can help people. therefore, my long-term goal is to work in a company where i can make use of my creativity and also help to make a positive impact on the world. to achieve this, i plan to get as much experience as possible before i graduate through internships or practical work experience. 
once i graduate, i plan on travelling overseas where i will continue to build on work experience within the IT field. i am particularly interested in software development and user interface. i believe learning about cybersecurity will broaden my perspective on possible career objectives, and also be of use in my future endeavours.
