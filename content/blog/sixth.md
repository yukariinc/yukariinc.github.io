### the showcase.

the showcase was a fun experience because it was where i got to display my newly acquired skillset to other students and tutors. it's hard to believe now that only a few weeks ago, i was as clueless as they were when they saw our hacking demo. my group met a few times throughout the week to plan our final presentation, and i am glad we did because i feel our final result was quite nice. we used messenger to communicate and share information outside of face-to-face time. i think our group dynamic worked quite well and everybody worked hard to deliver a good showcase. 

### the deliverable. 

the final deliverable was a full write-up of a *hackthebox* machine that we haven't done yet. i decided to go with 'traverxec'. doing this machine made me realise how far i have come in pentesting. although it was still challenging, i felt that i could apply the techniques i used in 'openadmin' here, and had a lot more direction in my approach to the machine. my classmates were happy to help me when i was stuck and pushed me in the right direction. thanks to this, i only spent about half the time on 'traverxec' of what i spent on 'openadmin'. i really look forward to completing more boxes even after this studio is over, to hone my skills and learn even more. 

### from hereon...
it's a bittersweet feeling knowing that our class will not have the same labs anymore. i grew to really like my classmates and tutors, and am thankful to them for making each class as enjoyable as it was. because of them, i joined the UTS cyber security society and plan on attending the *bsides* conference in canberra to keep improving my pentesting skills.
