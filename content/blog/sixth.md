### the showcase.

the showcase was a fun experience because it was where i got to display my newly acquired skillset to other students and tutors. it's hard to believe now that only a few weeks ago, i was as clueless as they were when they saw our hacking demo. my group met a few times throughout the week to plan our final presentation, and i am glad we did because i feel our final result was quite nice. we used messenger to communicate and share information outside of face-to-face time. i think our group dynamic worked quite well and everybody worked hard to deliver a good showcase.

### the deliverable. 

the final deliverable was a full write-up of a *hackthebox* machine that we haven't done yet. i decided to go with 'traverxec'. doing this machine made me realise how far i have come in pentesting. although it was still challenging, i felt that i could apply the techniques i used in 'openadmin' here, and had a lot more direction in my approach to the machine. my classmates were happy to help me when i was stuck and pushed me in the right direction. thanks to this, i only spent about half the time on 'traverxec' compared to what i spent on 'openadmin'. i really look forward to completing more boxes even after this studio is over, to hone my skills and learn even more. 

### from hereon...
it's a bittersweet feeling knowing that our class will not have the same labs anymore. i grew to really like my classmates and tutors, and am thankful to them for making each class as enjoyable as it was. because of them, i joined the UTS cyber security society and plan on attending the *bsides* conference in canberra to keep improving my pentesting skills. 

### SLO's
1. i interacted with everyone who came to the showcase as stakeholders. they came to our stall to learn more about what we have been doing in the studio, and i assisted them by talking with them about my experience in this subject and what i got out of it.
2. design and systems thinking was applied when tackling the deliverable. the 'traverxec' challenge required out-of-the-box tactics to arrive at the solution because of the unique nature of the exploits. apart from this, the presentation our group prepared also challenged the norms with both live and pre-recorded demonstration and by actively engaging with the audience throughout the showcase. 
3. technical skills was definitely a huge part of completing this week's deliverable. it is thanks to all the dedication in the previous weeks that i was able to line up the necessary skills to complete 'traverxec'. this mostly involved knowledge of reconnaissance tools and exploits from boxes i rooted in the past. i also feel that i do not need to rely on google and walkthroughs anywhere near as much as i would have before, so i know that my skills are sticking with me as long as i practice.
4. i communicated constantly this week with my tutors, class and groupmates, and with the stakeholders at the showcase. collaboration was required to deliver the presentation, and i also reached out with my classmates to assist and be assisted in completing 'traverxec' and 'openadmin'.
5. the final week was stressful, challenging and rewarding. now that i have arrived at the finish line, i feel glad that i pushed through all the challenges i was put against and am thankful for everything that happened. i feel that the quality of my work has also improved since week 1, and i think that i am a lot more confident and knowledgeable in cybersecurity compared to before. a more detailed evaluation of my progress can be seen in my [final reflection](https://thisisyukari.me/blog/final-portfolio/).
