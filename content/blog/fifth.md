### *we're almost there...*

the contents of this week made me realise how far our class has come since the beginning of the term. in five weeks, i got from not knowing what pentesting was to hacking a number of systems. although this week, like the others, was really challenging, i felt myself being pushed to learn a lot more on effective ways to hack a system. 

### hackthebox.
our first task this week was to create an account for *hackthobox*, a site that compiles vulnerable systems for users to exploit. fittingly, the process of obtaining an account involved hacking. this made it really satisfying when i finally obtained the invite code. 

for this week's deliverable we had to get the user hash for one of three boxes: openadmin, traverxec and postman. i decided to go with openadmin. 

this challenge induced many late nights at home and in the labs. (shoutout to jason who helped me in the labs until 11pm on thursday. your dedication is reciprocated by being immortalised on the university's ssd.)

although acquiring user for this box was a huge hurdle for me, i managed to succeed with the aid of the tutors and persistence.

### the stakeholders.

our stakeholders this week were nathan and pieter from *deloitte*, a multinational professional services company. they provided an interesting talk on how cybersecurity is relevant in their industry today and what kind of work they do as a part of the security team. i learned that this field is constantly changing, meaning there are always new challenges to solve. this intrigues me because it means you can work on something new all the time, and it's always a learning experience. 
however, the biggest thing i took away from this presentation was that pentesters have a great knack for naming their teams...

we were also given a virtual box to hack into. however with the short time-span they gave us to do this, i didn't manage to get passed the enumeration stage with *netdiscover* and *dirbuster*. i plan on attempting this box again after all my deliverables are done, with the aid of the demo that we also got from our stakeholders.

###our next deliverable.
the next deliverable we have assigned to us is a group presentation where we give a demonstration on acquiring root on a hackthebox machine. we formed our groups in class and will be holding our first meeting early next week.

### SLO progression.

1. i engaged with my tutors, classmates and guests from deloitte to get a better understanding of the various tasks i had this week. 
2. i took on a design and systems mindframe by doing lots of research on what kind of tools were available and how to use them through google.
3. i applied the skills i have accumulated through this to complete the deliverable for this week, details can be seen in the write-up.
4. i communicated with my peers and stakeholders inside and outside of class. i feel a lot closer with my class now that we have spent five weeks together, and this made interactions a lot easier and enjoyable.
5. this week has been quite a heavy challenge as there were many tasks to complete and i had final exams for another subject coming up. however, i am happy i got to the user stage in openadmin and i plan on acquiring root as soon as possible.

### reflection.
this week involved multiple challenges and i think i devoted all the time i could in solving them. when my time was limited, i really felt the insufficiency in my skillset which was enormously discouraging. even so, i persisted and i am now quite happy that i did, though i still have a long way to go. although i can feel the build-up in stress and workload towards the final week, i can't help but feel a little sad that i won't get to come to class and see everybody again after next week. i plan on continuing the challenges and hope to have a decent portfolio by the end of week 6.
