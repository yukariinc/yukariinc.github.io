### to be honest, i'm not sure what i am getting myself into. 

even though i'm in my fourth year of doing a science in IT degree, i have surprisingly not touched the cybersecurity field at all. this worried me because i knew how big of a role it played in the digital world, and i've always had a general interest in the subject. 

so, here i am in the summer studio. i was a little nervous when i learned that quite a lot of people in my class have had experience with cybersecurity, but the student teachers were really friendly and helped me feel motivated to take on this challenge. 

our first task was to build this website portfolio where i'm keeping this blog. although i've written websites in the past, this was the first time i had to use github and markdown to do so. it was a challenge, but once i understood the concepts of git and static sites i started finding it really enjoyable. this task made me learn 3 invaluable commands in git:

#### git add -A
#### git commit -m "comment"
#### git push
#### .

as well as useful tools like netlify and hugo. we haven't really delved into the realm of cybersecurity yet this week, but i look forward to the tasks from hereon.
