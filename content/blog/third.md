### *achievement unlocked...?*

this was the first week where we got to try our hands at penetration testing in class. as a practical learner, i found this really engaging and educational. however, there were a few obstacles throughout the week that made it quite difficult. if i keep up my momentum and motivation to work for this subject, i know i can learn so much more in the coming weeks.

### *weekly recap*

class this week mostly involved self-study, as opposed to the previous weeks, where we were introduced to different stakeholders. 

in a normal class, students would typically be taught the theoretical concepts of a subject, be given a demonstration of how to apply this and then be told to apply this newfound knowledge in a task. 

however, in this class we were instead given a list of resources and told to give them a go. at first this was expectedly overwhelming, but when i was able to maintain my focus i found that this method of learning forced me to work harder and ask questions. 

although i looked through all the resources that were given to us, i stuck with using owasp's juice shop while googling solutions the most. i created my own instance of juice shop in [github](https://github.com/yukariinc/juice-shop) using heroku so that i could take my time clearing each challenge by myself. thanks to this, i could repeat each challenge a few times to help me remember the pentesting techniques and rely less on google each time. this week i managed to clear all the available first and second-star challenges, and i hope to continue to the higher levels in the coming weeks.

i also spent a few hours on picoCTF, but i wasn't very fond of the extremely slow-paced CLI game (i later learned that the challenges we were recommended are separate from the game, so i will need to go back another time and try these again).
