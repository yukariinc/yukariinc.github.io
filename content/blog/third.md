### *achievement unlocked...?*

this was the first week where we got to try our hands at penetration testing in class. as a practical learner, i found this really engaging and educational. however, there were a few obstacles throughout the week that made it quite difficult. if i keep up my momentum and motivation to work for this subject, i know i can learn so much more in the coming weeks.

### weekly recap

class this week mostly involved self-study, as opposed to the previous weeks, where we were introduced to different stakeholders. 

in a normal class, students would typically be taught the theoretical concepts of a subject, be given a demonstration of how to apply this and then be told to apply this newfound knowledge in a task. 

however, in this class we were instead given a list of resources and told to give them a go. at first this was expectedly overwhelming, but when i was able to maintain my focus i found that this method of learning forced me to work harder and ask questions. 

although i looked through all the resources that were given to us, i stuck with using owasp's juice shop while googling solutions the most. i created my own instance of juice shop in [github](https://github.com/yukariinc/juice-shop) using heroku so that i could take my time clearing each challenge by myself. thanks to this, i could repeat each challenge a few times to help me remember the pentesting techniques and rely less on google each time. this week i managed to clear all the available first and second-star challenges, and i hope to continue to the higher levels in the coming weeks.

### the deliverable

this week's deliverable was a lot like last week's. except, we had a new group of three and had to do a presentation on a web application exploit. after completing last week's sprint, this one seemed very doable and our group did not have much trouble getting the presentation done. we used MS teams again to communicate, which went a lot more smoothly this time because we had one less person in the group to reach. on the day of the presentation however, one group member was sick so we had to present with just two people. as someone who isn't confident at public speaking in general, i found this really challenging. as a result, i got to learn a lot about the LFI technique and other web app exploits like XXS and SQL injection from the various presentations.

### other things i did this week

i also spent a few hours on picoCTF, but i wasn't very fond of the extremely slow-paced CLI game (i later learned that the challenges we were recommended are separate from the game, so i will need to go back another time and try these again).

to increase my engagement with stakeholders and possibly gain some connections with people in the industry, i was recommended to participate in a sectalks meetup. i was really keen for this, but unfortunately i did not make it into the signups :(

as a way to self-study, i began listening to the "cybersecurity effectiveness podcast" by verodin on spotify to learn a little more on the field. this podcast goes into the depths of corporate cybersecurity and introduces many experts in the field to discuss the importance of security and the typical interactions of security analysts. i would recommend this podcast to anyone who is considering pursuing this career as it explains the worldview of hackers in a very digestable way. 

### SLO progression
this week i achieved the SLO's by...
1. signing up to the sectalks meetup (hey, i tried.)
2. applied design and system thinking by looking for creative ways to approach this week's sprint.
3. honed my skills in pentesting by researching and practicing with LFI and other techniques explored in juice shop.
4. communicated and collaborated with my presentation group to complete our deliverable, and my classmates and tutors when i was stuck with some exploits.
5. writing a detailed reflection of my achievements and obstacles this week.

### reflection
this week felt like it went by really quickly, but that could be because of all the other commitments i've had as well. overall, i was glad that i got to try my hands at actual pentesting, but i still feel behind compared to my experienced classmates. i understand now that most of the contents in this subject is going to be learned through self-study, so i will need to continue exploring other educational resources like youtube and podcasts. 

my goals for next week is to try and maintain focus (i found that working outside  has helped a lot with this rather than working from home), and understand more web app exploitation techniques. specifically, i want to complete the more difficult three-star challenges in juicebox and explore other applications i can try and penetrate. after the spike in learning content this week, i'm looking forward to what next week is going to offer.
