*achievement unlocked...?*

this was the first week where we got to try our hands at penetration testing in class. as a practical learner, i found this really engaging and educational. however, there were a few obstacles throughout the week that made it quite difficult. if i keep up my momentum and motivation to work for this subject, i know i can learn so much more in the coming weeks.
