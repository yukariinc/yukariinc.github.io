### __so... cybersecurity__

after the feedback session, i am more confident in what i need to work on to improve my results. so, i've made it my goal for this week to get my current portfolio up to the standard expected from me. 


### _recap of this week_

we began the week by interacting with two notable stakeholders  (hey, that's SLO 1!). patrick kelso and rob mitchell were both experts in the field we are studying and had some really interesting stories about where cybersecurity can be used. 

to be honest from the little knowledge i've had about cybersecurity previously, i felt like i couldn't completely follow the talks from both stakeholders. i was also hesitant about asking questions because i could tell a few of my classmates already understood many of the concepts we are studying from the kind of questions they were asking. but, this encouraged me to look into the topics discussed in my own time.

i've had some experience with linux in the past, but seeing how passionate patrick was inspired me to get back into using command line interfaces. what stuck with me from his talk was how customisable linux interfaces can be. [this subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/uniXporn) was particularly interesting to browse, and i also looked into  window managers like i3 (the one patrick was talking about) and awesome. this made me think about installing ubuntu again, but i should probably work on getting familiar with kali first.

rob's talk was really interesting and helped me understand more about the impact of cybersecurity in the real world. i feel his talk gave me a foundation for learning more about the field and inspired me in terms of considering my career prospects. two things that i regretted after rob's talk were not knowing these things earlier, and not asking him more questions about the stories he shared. 

### _the deliverable._

our deliverable this week was to organise a four-minute group presentation in two days. this was a huge challenge because it's the first time i was expected to deliver an assignment in such a short period of time, with people i wasn't familiar with. 

#### my approach
i joined a group with three other people who i never talked with. our group discussion was fast paced in the beginning as we decided on the reconnaissance tool to research and split the work as quickly as possible. we used MS teams to communicate and share files.

#### what i learned from this task.
- what nikto is and briefly how to use it.
- an overview of different reconnaissance tools, like nmap and gobuster.
- the importance of effective communication and time management in group assignments.

#### what i found challenging about this task.
- lack of resources on nikto, particularly tutorials.
- uncertainty of how the presentation will go as we didn't have time to rehearse and time it.
- unsatisfactory levels of communication and time management among the group. in retrospect, we should have used a means other than MS teams to communicate and document work.

#### overall...
this week's deliverable took me by surprise, but there was a lot i learned through both independent study and discussing with my groupmates. this sprint has definitely forced me to think like a problem-solver and step outside my comfort-zone to state my thoughts and concerns about the presentation clearly to my group (there's SLO 2!).

### _other things i did this week_
i began playing through the levels in [bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and got to level 15. this was a really good challenge to review my command-line skills and learn some new things (hey could that be SLO 3?). the fact that it works like a game also made it enjoyable to get through. there were a few times when i got stuck, so i approached my team leaders and classmates for help. in return, i also helped others who were stuck on levels below me (hmm, sounds like that could be SLO 4...). 

### _reflection_
although i still didn't really understand what cybersecurity is about until after the census date had passed, i'm really glad that i stuck with this subject. after working on this week's deliverables and self-study, i noticed how much i needed to sort out my time management issues and communicate effectively with those around me. picking up from this week, my goal for next week is to keep increasing the pace of my work and to minimise procrastination. if i can focus equally on both the quality and quantity of my work, i think this could be a subject where i can actually do quite well (and there's SLO 5!).
