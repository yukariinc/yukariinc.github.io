### *this was probably my worst week since beginning this studio.*

there were many obstacles this week where i became stuck for a lot longer than i had hoped, pulling me behind from getting my sprint and deliverable completed within a reasonable time.

### monday
it didn't take me long to realise that running 2 virtual machines on a laptop with 4GB of ram was not feasible. despite being introduced to vulnerable boxes like 'basic pentesting' and 'wakanda', all i could do was watch the demos and try to follow what was happening. but, with my lack of experience in hacking i was lost very quickly. i left class early so i can work on this on a more reliable PC, but i ended up spending the rest of the day installing vmware and setting up kali.

### wednesday
my plan for today was to complete *basic pentesting 1* and *vulnversity* so that i got an idea of how to solve these boxes before i approach my deliverable. however after coming into class i ran into issues with connecting to the vpn and maintaining a stable connection to the server. working in the shell was *extremely* slow making it difficult. i spent around 6 hours in class, however about 5 of those hours were spent waiting for scans and connections. i think if i had given up and done the rest of the work elsewhere, i would have had a much more productive day.

### thursday
 after consulting the tutors i learned the slow connectivity was caused by a firewall issue with UTS. i tried connecting through my mobile hotspot instead, but this was still not much better. i tried to complete *basic pentesting 1* today because it did not require openVPN, however i still struggled with slow connection speeds. being in class was quite stress-inducing this week because i seemed to have issues while my classmates paced ahead of me. but, this did give me a good opportunity to consult my tutors who were really happy to help. in the end, i accepted that i would need to do the majority of my work at home and studied theory during classtime by looking at tutorials on pentesting.
