# summer studio 2020.

### *welcome to the most challenging, informative, and rewarding six weeks of my life.*

## introduction.

looking back, it is difficult to believe how far i have come in a bit over a month. previous to the studio i had no knowledge on cybersecurity and only had some experience in programming and networking. now, i am successfully hacking vulnerable machines and completing CTF challenges. this is all thanks to my wonderful tutors, larry zekster, jason ko and max caminer, who were passionate in their teaching and patient with all their students when we struggled to understand some of the more difficult topics. the guests who came in were also extremely helpful in getting us to understand real-word problems cybersecurity analysts and engineers face. the following reflection will show how the five subject learning outcomes (SLO's) were obtained throughout the last six weeks. 

## the reflection.

1. engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.

throughout this term, we were introduced to a variety of stakeholders from the cybersecurity field, all of whom gave us insights to the problems that exist within systems and applications security. 
- week 1: matthew brennan from *indue* gave us an introduction to cybersecurity as a career. the problems he faced on a daily basis as a cybersecurity analyst was managing communication between those in his workplace who do understand computing and those who don't. this was a problem because those who don't understand computing often underestimate the damage that can be caused by not updating software regularly and ensuring a secure system infrastructure. he also highlighted the problem of not staying up-to-date with information about the constantly changing cybersecurity meta, and attending conference regularly to fix this.
- week 2: patrick kelso from UTS demonstrated expert-level ways to use linux operating systems. i learned that my problem at this stage is that my level of understanding for navigating linux-based systems was too low at this point in time. patrick's talk inspired me to keep practicing with applications like *overthewire*'s 'bandit' to improve my skills. rob mitchell from *gitlab* was another stakeholder who shared many stories about his experience with his career as a strategic sercurity manager. he gave a very good overview on this history of cybersecurity which was invaluable in helping us identify problems in the subject, because we must first understand what we are looking for before we define the problem. 
- week 5: nathan jones and pieter westein from *deloitte* presented to us about red and blue team pentesting. we were also given a virtual machine to hack, and i got to scope this problem with the guests. by week 5 i have acquired much more knowledge about pentesting, and was able to identify problems like vulnerable ports and exploitable applications which was a huge improvement since week 1.

i have also consulted with my tutors many times throughout the course to assist with problem identification. when i was stuck on a segment in any of the hacking challenges, the tutors always pointed me in the right direction without giving away the solution. this made me understand the problem a lot better thus allowing me to discover a solution i wouldn't have thought of otherwise. 

2. apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem. 

design and systems thinking was an essential part to completing this course. all of our deliverables, challenges and the portfolio involved creative approaches to reaching a solution. the presentations that we organised as part of our deliverables were created with design and systems thinking by brainstorming and reciting ways to deliver it in an effective way. this included recording video demos, making slide shows and reporting on our given topics. 
the creation of this portfolio required design and systems thinking, since we had to design our websites from scratch with hugo. the format i have written this portfolio in is a stylistic choice that was deployed after going through many iterations in the earlier weeks. 

CTF challenges particularly required a design and systems thinking approach to solve. this is because there are no set steps one must take when hacking into root on vulnerable systems and applications. instead, we were forced to think of new ways to privilege-escalate, and these ways were often things we would have never considered on the first try. for example, one of the steps to get the root in *hackthebox*'s 'traverxec' involved changing the window size while running a script - something that i never would have considered without multiple attempts doing everything else. 

one thing i realised was that the more challenges i completed, the more variety in approaches i had when doing the next challenge. for example, when approaching a new box i would now use tools like *nmap* and *gobuster* instinctively, because these came in handy when i did all the previous boxes. i feel more confident now in trying everything that worked for be before, then going on to see if there are new methods that i have not thought of yet.

3. apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs. 

learning the technical skills was personally the biggest part of this studio. since week 1, i felt my pentesting skills develop from literally nothing to a somewhat okay hacker. this was something i thought i would never accomplish, and am extremely thankful to my enouraging tutors for. 

these technical skills ultimately guided me to hacking the machines in *hackthebox*, and i would like to highlight the specific skills i picked up every week.
- week 1: i learned about git repositories and how to use them, which was essential for finding and downloading open-source scripts that i used for exploitation.
- week 2: i learned about reconnaissance tools like nmap, nikto, gobuster and metasploit, all of which i now use regularly for CTF challenges. 
- week 3: i learned about common web app exploitation techniques like SQL injection, cross site scripting (XSS) and local file injection among others. without this knowledge i would have no idea how to approach application exploitation on vulnerable systems.
- week 4: i combined what i learned in weeks 2 and 3 to do some simple CTF challenges from *tryhackme* and *vulnhub*. this let me conceptualise the theory i have learned into practical application.
- week 5: while combining everything i have learned so far to complete *hackthebox*'s 'openadmin', i also picked up new tools like john, and learned about other exploitation techniques like GTFObins.  

thanks to the skills i have acquired mentioned above, i can use them practically to pentest vulnerable systems. proof of these can be seen in my openadmin and traverxec write-ups. 

4. demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills.

5. conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.
